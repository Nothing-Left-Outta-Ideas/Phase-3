          The difference between physical and mental health is not as pronounced as you might think. For years, researchers have been asking a complex question — how do mental and physical health interact? The answer is predictably complicated, but we do know that mental illness impacts physical health directly and indirectly. Take a look at some of the concrete ways your body and mind influence each other.
            <br/><br/>
           This article is a well laid out summary of the importance of physical health and essential tips that can help to improve how you relate with your body..

                <h2>Sleep  </h2>
             Not getting enough sleep can exacerbate mental health problems. According to Harvard Medical School, individuals with a history of insomnia are four times as likely to develop depression. Conversely, more than 50 percent of people with anxiety and up to 90 percent of people with depression experience sleep problems of some kind.
Sleep routines are especially important for kids. Without enough sleep, children can suffer from weakened immune systems and problems in academic performance, behavior, and decreased mental health overall.

:
              Creating a schedule and routine around adequate sleep is an effective step toward improving mental health for yourself or a child in your care. Developing a sleep routine can be as simple as setting a concrete bedtime, limiting or removing screen access for an hour before bed and capping off the night with your favorite herbal tea blend or a glass of warm milk

                        <h2>Schedule </h2>Working with your hands is a time-tested way to reduce the symptoms of depression and improve mental health. Half of your brain’s cortex is dedicated to the hands, so a hands-on hobby gives your brain a good workout.
You don’t need to take up mechanical engineering to benefit from hands-on activity. An art or cooking class will activate the same effects. Children’s brain development requires a healthy mix of cognitive and physical activity, so any hobby involving the use of hands alongside the mind will help them develop and maintain better mental health.

.Self-care is a crucial component to mental health, but in many cases, mental illness requires help from qualified experts. Counseling and dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) teach individuals how to cope with mental illness that disrupts their everyday lives. Self-care can go a long way, only as a supplement to treatment programs designed to address your or a child’s disorder at the root.

                     The way we think about something has a big effect on the way we feel. If we feel like we can handle a problem, we often feel good. If we do not think that we can handle a problem, we often feel bad.
